We want to tear high-brow scientific and sociological discussions down from their lofty ivory towers into the muddy world of unhinged humor, fart jokes and shitposting. We want to create a platform for real, rational, intellectually honest discussion that also happens to be unbound by the decorum of polite society. We want to bring big ideas to the people - the real people, not the 1 percenters, not the bots. In other wordsâ€¦ a black market for science and culture. This is the academy of the streets and class is in session.
