*Earlier this year I graduated from the University of Toronto. I spent six years in the institution and earned two degrees. During my studies I spent a good amount of time on the school’s subreddit - an online forum run by students for students. On my way out, I wanted to provide some parting words to my fellow terminally-online degenerates. I’ve always found catharsis in sharing hardships, and in having my experiences validated by others. Figured I’d try to do that for some students who lived the same way I had. This is the Meat Grinder - an essay about tough shit in university, and what perseverance can look like. You can access the original reddit post and subsequent discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/10egczc/six_years_and_two_degrees_later_im_leaving_u_of_t/).* 

### TL;DR
Had some tough times in university. Learned a lot about myself. Wish I’d done a lot differently. But I don’t look back on much of it with regret and I’m grateful for the lessons learned. If you’re going through tough times, accept them – you are not lesser for it, this place can be a Meat Grinder. Compete with nobody but yourself. Do not demand perfection of yourself, only demand honest effort and progress. Nothing in life is guaranteed except change, so gamble on things changing for the better. Show up with whatever you can muster, even (especially?) if it feels like a losing battle.


I’ve been frequenting this forum for years. I’m a grizzled veteran of the Great Meme War waged against Waterloo and bore witness to the Goose Tattoo. I’ve tried to offer advice to younger life science students that I wish I’d gotten when I was in their shoes. Throughout long periods of isolation, obtaining the tiniest sense of community by lurking in this virtual hive of scum and villainy often ended up being genuinely cathartic. I’d like to repay the favour by sharing some of my experiences, specifically directed at anyone who might be struggling. This is a pretty abstract pile of ramblings – if anybody’s interested in talking about more concrete stuff like coursework, research or jobs, my inbox is always open.

# It's okay to have a hard time in the Meat Grinder…
Sometimes U of T is a school. It’s about learning for the joy of it, pure discovery, intellectual mastery. I’ve experienced that side. But sometimes it becomes the Meat Grinder. Depends on your program, of course, and how you approach achievement, and the pressures placed upon you. But if you allow it to really sink its teeth in, if instead of being a student you become a worker, and the thrill of the journey becomes replaced by the single-minded pursuit of the destination, the university stops being a school. It becomes the Meat Grinder and it’ll chew you up just as hungrily as any faceless corporation. This can happen to anybody.


So, throw away the expectations placed upon you by the cultural morass. “University is the best time in your life.” I mean, maybe! If this is the best time in your life, that’s awesome, genuinely. But if it’s not, don’t listen to the burned-out cynics who will try to convince you that “it’s all downhill from here.” It doesn’t have to be. It hasn’t been for me. My overall sense of self and wellbeing improved dramatically after I finished undergrad, and a similar jump happened after I decided to leave graduate school at the Master’s level.


If you’re one of those students weathering a gruelling commute in the numbing dead-of-February weather, sweating bullets in a stalled subway car on your way to an 8:30 am organic chemistry lab that you’re damn sure about to bomb (assuming you make it there at all), coming from a low-income background and weighed down by the pressures that legacy entails, if you’re just trying to hold yourself together, never mind trying to enjoy yourself – I see you and I hear you, because I was you, and so were several of my friends. And if you’re from anywhere else, any other background, if you’re just having a hard time for any reason, you are not alone. You are not messed up or deficient or lesser than anyone else for going through these trials. Let me be clear – I don’t think university is supposed to be some hellish trial. I don’t think it’s supposed to be anything, really. I just think it’s real easy for it to become the Meat Grinder, and for students to become unwittingly complicit in their own consumption at the hands (teeth?) of the institution. And I think the pressure to feel and be different (read: better) can beget a lot of unnecessary shame. Maybe there’s ways to fix this. I reckon the first step is admitting and accepting that it happens, and that there’s real beauty in being a work in progress.

# …just know that, this too, shall pass.
A solid 80% of the negative things in my life are a result of decisions where either **fear** or **shame** were my primary motivation. And fear is a hard loop to break out of. It feeds itself.

I regret never reaching out for help. I have no experience with the university’s health and wellness program because I denied my mental health issues for the entirety of my time here, brute forcing my way through some stuff I really shouldn’t have done alone. In hindsight, I can now see how my fear of admitting that I had problems made them worse. Reach out to somebody. The Meat Grinder is full of strugglers. And while they may not be able to directly help you, there can be comfort in camaraderie and real empathy. There is nothing more imperative to success at U of T than building a solid social network – nothing. Sure, people will walk in and out of your life, but even their momentary presence can have a profound positive impact.


I had a hard time building that network. There’s still some days where I feel like a [pigeon man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H67hGgfT_iw&t=6s). Maybe some of you do, too. I try to remind myself that I’m still moving forward. There is a pressure and expectation to be fully formed that worms its way into your psyche in a high-achieving environment like U of T, and it can counterintuitively make personal growth harder (i.e., the “I’m such a screwup, why bother” mantra). So trust in the journey and don’t give up on people, least of all yourself. Life guarantees a few things (not many), and foremost among them is change. Tomorrow will not be like today – to assume otherwise is not only arrogant, but completely inane. The world won’t stand still for anyone. And sure, that means tomorrow might be worse, but dammit it might well be better. Bet on it being better and [get out of the car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwoyo0Rt4Bw).

# Showing Up
Competition is healthy, but there’s only one competitor worth taking seriously. Not the LinkedIn algorithm, not the rat-race, the GPA scale – your only competitor should be the version of you in your head that thinks you can’t do it, that thinks giving up is virtuous. Kick that person’s ass. Prove them wrong beyond a sliver of a doubt. And do it by showing up. Disregard the results of yesterday and the ones of tomorrow when you’re making the decision. Didn’t study for the exam? Hate working out? Show up anyway. Show up and and give 100% of what you are able to give on that day. And if that’s only 10 minutes just walking around the gym and side-eying the squat rack, if that’s 10 minutes just working on one sentence in the essay, so be it. You can manage 10 minutes. There’s no need to “just do it.” Just show up. Yoda was wrong - do or do not, there is **always** the try.

# Things I Wish I’d Done (and Probably Would Recommend Doing)
I wish I’d taken my time with undergrad. I had good reasons for gunning it and graduating in four years, but I’d have loved to just explore courses out of curiosity and taken greater advantage of being a student at this world-class institution. More philosophy, more history, more psych.
I wish I’d listened to my gut more. I tried to find a compromise between a “realistic” career path and something I felt passionate about, and it was a mistake that I’m only now trying to fix.


I wish I’d made some friends to get sloshed with after finals in the quad. Or come out of my shell in the clubs I joined. Or had the chance to hold hands with someone special on the front campus. I wish I’d made my band work and played some gigs. Wish I’d made more genuinely good memories of this place involving people I cared about and been more of a human than a [replicant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrP-_T-h9YM). It’s okay to be alone but **feeling** alone is something quite different. I wish I’d put the same amount of work into avoiding that feeling as I did into my coursework.


I wish I’d told myself the things I told others and **believed** them. “Your GPA doesn’t define you.” “Be kind to yourself.” “Your mental health should be your number one priority.” Words are cheap, too easy. Still working on this one.

# In conclusion, or something
I don’t have any concrete suggestions for what U of T should do to improve the undergrad experience (if that’s even their responsibility or something they’re capable of doing. Regardless, I’m grateful to have gone to this school. I’ve had opportunities many people throughout history would have killed for. I learned a lot. I made some money, never mind breaking even. I pushed myself past what I thought I was capable of and came out the other end stronger.


If there are any prospective applicants getting scared off by some of the stuff in this post, I apologize. University can be a tough transition for anyone regardless of the school you choose, but it’s in that toughness that real growth is found. Adversity gives you an opportunity to really meet yourself for the first time, and that’s not something to shy away from.


I wish every one of you the absolute best of luck moving forward. If you’re doing well, I can’t overstate how awesome that is - keep shining. If you’re feeling alone, overworked, desperate – reach out to whoever is accessible, believe that something beautiful can come from your efforts, momentarily step away from things if you can, and just stick around. Take life as it comes and don’t place more importance on things than they deserve. And above all, be proud of how far you’ve come. Every one of you reading this has done incredible things and has the capacity for not only genuine greatness (however you might define that) but the ability to build a happy, fulfilling life. I don’t mean these to be self-congratulatory platitudes – I’ve been around this student body long enough to have an ironclad belief in every single damn one of you crazy MFers. You’re all gonna make it. The path might not be what you expected, but you will walk it.
In conclusion, or something… when the bell rings and you’re facing that old version of yourself, or the Meat Grinder, or whatever else might be standing across the ring ready to punch your lights out… [go out, touch gloves, and give them hell](https://youtu.be/-DoaUyMGPWI?t=6840).
