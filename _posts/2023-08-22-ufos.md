**The year is 2017**. Luiz Elizondo, a former counterintelligence officer for the US government, blows the whistle on the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), an agency created by Senator Harry Reid in 2007 with the express purpose of studying UFOs (“unexplained aerial phenomena” or UAPs if you’re a Pentagon cool kid). Elizondo not only claims to have been the agency’s director, but that it sucked up a previously unaccounted $22 million over its five years of life. Though it had been dissolved in 2012, Elizondo alleges that AATIP continued to receive funding in subsequent years, and appeared to make his exit based on dissatisfaction with the agency’s response to (in his opinion) credible accounts of “beyond next-generation” aircraft. 

**The year is 2017**. Christopher Mellon, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in the Pentagon and a man who just one year prior categorically quashed any rumours of the US government “concealing UFO information” (refer to this Huffpost interview), leaks a series of videos to the press. They’ve been obtained by fighter pilots between the years 2004 and 2015, and contain cockpit and infrared data documenting the movement of… things. Things that veteran fighter pilots David Fravor and Ryan Graves, among dozens of other experienced military and intelligence personnel, cannot explain.

The Pentagon hems and haws. After the New York Times publishes a story accounting Elizondo’s claims alongside Mellon’s video footage, mum’s the word for a good two years before an official statement is released in 2019 – Elizondo, they claim, was never one of AATIP’s directors and had no intimate knowledge of the association they are now forced to admit did exist. On the other hand, the agency’s founder Senator Reid publicly goes to bat for Elizondo and backs up his leadership credentials at AATIP. A year later, the Pentagon releases Mellon’s videos into the public domain, verifies they’re legit, states that the phenomena in those videos remain unidentified and explicitly does not rule out an extraterrestrial or non-human origin for the craft. Elizondo, Mellon, Fravor and Graves, for their part, do not believe that the maneuvers of the craft documented in the videos (such as the now rather infamous [TIC-TAC craft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auITEKd4sjA)) are possible with any technology currently accessible to humans. 

Somebody is lying or deluded. Make the call for yourself, but from my standing the UFO truthers aren’t seeming so crazy anymore. We have come a long way from the likes of Bob Lazar (a rabbit hole for another day). 

Now, I’m not saying it’s aliens. But… ![](../assets/images/aliens.jpg)

Listen, we don’t need to draw any sweeping conclusions right now, but let’s at least agree that the frog is evidently being boiled slowly. All it took was a slick rebranding of UFOs to UAPs for the general public to quietly accept their diffusion into the world of congressional hearings and New York Times headlines. Seriously – a cabal of high-ranking, well respected intelligence and military personnel start blowing the whistle about years (if not decades) of governmental research into vehicles of unknown origin and highlight their apparent breaking of known physical laws, and the 24 hour news cycle swallows the story up just as mercilessly as it did the latest celebrity divorce or off-colour tweet. That’s what happened in 2017, at least. And it’s happening again, now.

Only this time… maybe this time it won’t get swallowed so easily. Maybe the frog’s feet are starting to sting a little bit.

**Enter David Grusch**. A US air force officer and former intelligence official bearing all the fruits of a high-security clearance files a whistleblower complaint. He informs the Intelligence Community Inspector General (the dude in charge of auditing the intelligence community; essentially, he’s watching the watchmen) about his intentions to share information about UAPs and wants protection against retaliation from higher-ups (something he alleges already happened). The ICIG evidently takes this seriously, because Grusch and his lawyer Charles McCullough (a former ICIG himself!) end up in front of Congress on national TV. Fravor and Graves are also present and share their experiences and interpretations of the 2017 UAP videos. 

Congress takes Grusch seriously. They ask him pointed questions. He claims that the federal government has not only recovered UAPs and engaged in a decades-long campaign of disinformation and cover-ups, but that “dead pilots” and “non-human biologics” were recovered from downed craft and that exorbitant sums of money have been poured into programs for reverse engineering UAP tech. He claims that “very disturbing” things have been done to people in and around the operation. 

Let’s pause for a second. Soak this in. A well-respected military official, backed by more military officials and a former Inspector General for the mothertrucking US intelligence community, goes on national TV talking about dead aliens in the possession of the US government. Dead bodies. They got ‘em. The trillions of missing Pentagon dollars (the organization has failed every audit it’s ever undergone, the most recent happening at the end of 2022)? Pumped into programs for reverse engineering physics-breaking UAP tech. 

Is he crazy? Wouldn’t that be simple? Is he one of our lying or deluded somebodies? Wouldn’t that be simple? 

I’m not sure how convincing I find either answer. 

It’s incredibly important to note that nothing Grusch stated publicly was information the Pentagon had classified - if it had been, Grusch would have gone the way of Snowden and be mouldering in a cell if he wasn’t halfway to Siberia. Grusch stated repeatedly that concrete names and details could be provided to Congress in a sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF - a location designated for the sharing of classified information to make sure things can’t leak). Grusch does not share first-hand evidence of craft or non-human intelligence, but claims he has directed around 40 individuals to the ICIG to share their information. 

The Department of Defense categorically denies Grusch’s claims of discovering or reverse-engineering extraterrestrial materials. The successor agency of sorts to AATIP, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) doesn’t back Grusch and claims he didn’t contact them (Grusch disputes this). NASA reiterates that they haven’t found any evidence of life anywhere else. A bevy of scientists and UFO historians aren’t convinced. 

Hard evidence is hard evidence, and Grusch has provided none. I have no interest in appealing to authority to justify claims in absence of it. But by the same token, I refuse to immediately discredit anyone who comes forward discussing UFOs/UAPs/non-human intelligence seriously, simply for the reason that they are doing so. We are past the point where seriously entertaining the possibility of non-human technology and/or life-forms having visited our planet is reserved for the designated loonies and tinfoil hat connoisseurs. With this many credible witnesses coming forward, it is very, very hard to completely dismiss the notion that Something Is Going On. 

So what’s going on? [Well, the way I see it there are three possibilities](https://youtu.be/GKPIrRMR9Gg?t=17).

* **A significant chunk of high-ranking, supposedly credible military and intelligence personnel in the arguably most powerful government on this planet are in fact deluded conspiracy theorists**. Perhaps they have been fooled by someone higher up and are honest in their delusions - perhaps they are straight up crazy, perhaps it’s a textbook example of groupthink or cultish nonsense, perhaps they are seeking some weird brand of fame. **If this is happening, seems like the American people should be concerned. It demands investigation**. These are people with top security clearances undergoing rounds of psychiatric evaluation flying fighter jets, for God’s sakes - if they’re nuts, that’s a Big Problem. 
    * **Counterpoint** - Many of the folks involved in the more recent whistleblowing events seem incredibly rational, coherent and measured in their claims. Christopher Mellon is an excellent example - an investor from an affluent family who has no apparent need of the supposedly lucrative money that comes from being a “crazy UFO guy” has spearheaded much of this movement. If the guy’s crazy, he’s damn good at hiding it. Which brings us to…

* It’s not a matter of craziness. **This is a psyop by the United States against its own people and foreign powers**. In order to cover up secret R&D programs and mind-blowing advancements in military vehicles and energy production, the Pentagon is leaning into the alien narrative. They’re feeding narratives about alien tech to high-ranking officials in order to But they’re doing it cautiously, trepidatiously - letting just enough folks speak out to make it seem plausible, feeding but not outright yelling about aliens to avoid serious examination of the claims. What’s the payoff here? Draw attention away from the activities of Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman, draw attention away from the Pentagon’s budget, and blame the aliens. Hell, maybe the Pentagon and allied defense contractors can spin some more money out of this whole debacle! **If this is happening, it is, without hyperbole, a crime against the human race. It demands investigation**. Hiding technology that could potentially solve our energy crisis and avert the climate change death-march we’re currently on in order to maximize defense contractor profits is… evil, there’s no other way of putting it. 
    * Counterpoint - The psyop doesn’t seem exceptionally effective. The vast majority of folks not only don’t believe Grusch, *they aren’t even aware of who the guy is*. Aliens have been deemed a nothing burger for decades upon decades. If the Pentagon wants to strike fear into the hearts of its enemies, surely there’s better ways to do this. If they want to swindle more money out of the feds… I mean, haven’t they already been doing a damn good job of that? Grusch’s testimony, if anything, has gotten a fair few senators sniffing around the Pentagon’s budget with a renewed interest. 
* **It’s aliens**. And if that’s the case, well, surprise surprise, I’d say **it demands investigation**.
